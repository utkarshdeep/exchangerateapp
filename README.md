# Exchange Rate App

An app build using the Django Python framework to evaluate Exchange Rate of currencies.


## Aim of the app
The challenge was to develop an app that provides the latest and historical exchange rate for the currency.

App is developed to do basically 2 things:

    1. Get the latest exchange rate of a currency against another currency. 
       Like how is 1 USD equal to INR currently.

## Description of the app
    1. The solution is full-stack with both back-end and front-end being packaged in one single code base.
    2. The reasoning for the choice of Python and Django framework to implement the solution are as follows:
        i. Pyhton is being used as it is easy to understand language and also becomes easy for other team members to 
        contribute with minimum basic knowledge. Also since Python is one of most widely used programming language, it
        has a huge community alongside which is helpful when you are stuck.
        ii. When choice of Python is made, the decision to use Django isn't a hard one to make. Alongside it have several
        added advantages viz. all-inclusive features & functionality; compatibility with ranges of Python libraries;
        scalability; community; security and faster development cycles.
    3. Trade-offs made while implementing the solution:
        i. UI/UX part could have been done better in term of asthetic and look of the website
        ii.
