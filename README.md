# Exchange Rate App

An app build using the Django Python framework to evaluate Exchange Rate of currencies.


## Aim of the app
The challenge was to develop an app that provides the latest and historical exchange rate for the currency.

TApp is developed to do basically 2 things:

    1. Get the latest exchange rate of a currency against another currency. 
       Like how is 1 USD equal to INR currently.

    2. It provides the historical exchange rate of most currencies against USD
       on a particular date.
